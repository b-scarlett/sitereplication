                    <h2>Lowers Blood Pressure</h2>
                    <p>Blood pressure is an important risk factor for heart disease, and honey may help lower it. This is because it contains antioxidant compounds that have been linked t lower blood pressure. Studies in both rats and humans have shown modest reductions in blood pressure from consuming honey.</p>

                    <h2>Antibacterial properties</h2>
                    <p>Honey contains hydrogen peroxide, which may account for some of its antibacterial properties. it also has a high sugar contant, which may can help stop the growth of certain bactteria. Additioanlly, honey has a low pH level. This works to pull moisture away from bacteria, causing the bacteria to get dehydrated and ie off.</p>

                    <p>I have been trying to embrace a more holistic life style and focussing on having a more natural, low processing and preservative diet. I have opted to reduce my sugar intake and change out to honey. I feel more assure that MTA honey valley is of the purest form as I have seen the GMPs employed by this company and have the confidence in their ethical practices. I also used honey in my skin care routine and have been seeing big positive changes </p>
